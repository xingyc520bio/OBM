# OBM
Opportunity business model 
##  Advantages
1. direct way of production, and no batch to batch variation
2. animal free
3. higher affinity effect

### Secondary antibody
Application	Types of secondary antibodies used

ELISA

Most commercial kits use streptavidin-HRP (biotinylated secondary) antibodies
Give stronger signal than conventional enzyme-labeled secondary antibodies

Immunocytochemistry

Secondary antibodies conjugated to enzymes
Biotinylated secondary antibodies
Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies
Poly-HRP–mediated tyramide signal amplification

Immunohistochemistry

Secondary antibodies conjugated to enzymes
Biotinylated secondary antibodies
Immunofluorescence

Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies
Poly-HRP–mediated tyramide signal amplification
Flow cytometry

Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies
Secondary antibodies conjugated to enzymes
Biotinylated secondary antibodies
Western blot	
Enzyme conjugated (HRP or AP) secondary antibodies are most commonly used
Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies are also available
Sensitivity of fluorescence-based detection is similar to that of chemiluminescence detection
Fluorescence-based detection allows for the detection of multiple fluorophores at the same time
