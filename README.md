# OBM
Opportunity business model 
##  Advantages
1. direct way of production, and no batch to batch variation
2. animal free
3. higher affinity effect

### Secondary antibody
Application	Types of secondary antibodies used

ELISA

Most commercial kits use streptavidin-HRP (biotinylated secondary) antibodies
Give stronger signal than conventional enzyme-labeled secondary antibodies

Immunocytochemistry

Secondary antibodies conjugated to enzymes
Biotinylated secondary antibodies
Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies
Poly-HRP–mediated tyramide signal amplification

Immunohistochemistry

Secondary antibodies conjugated to enzymes
Biotinylated secondary antibodies
Immunofluorescence

Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies
Poly-HRP–mediated tyramide signal amplification
Flow cytometry

Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies
Secondary antibodies conjugated to enzymes
Biotinylated secondary antibodies
Western blot	
Enzyme conjugated (HRP or AP) secondary antibodies are most commonly used
Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies are also available
Sensitivity of fluorescence-based detection is similar to that of chemiluminescence detection
Fluorescence-based detection allows for the detection of multiple fluorophores at the same time

# Journal 2 Friday Week7

Today we have a tutorial. I think I misunderstand what we should prepare. When Dr. Tiede asked us about our commercial idea about affimers, I said that we can use affimers to replace PD-L1 antibody in practice of CAR-T therapy because it is a really profitable area. But Dr. Tiede mentioned that it is already done by Avacta.



After that, I come up with another idea. Affimer are not easy to develop compare with antibodies, but they can be easily mass-produced in e.coli. So I thought about those scenarios where a large amount of same type of antibody were needed, that is secondary antibody !!!



I share my idea to Dr. Tiede and he asked me why you want to use affimer to replace antibody. I said that affimer is small, it may be more densely conjugated and have a higher signal strength. Dr. Tiede remind me that small size may be a drawback because affimer needs to bind a huge HRP enzyme. 



Dr. Tiede give us some of the guidance to think about other advantage. And I summarized his content into three points:

1. Affimer is animal free. When producing secondary antibody, we always use mammal. They need to be bled multiple times which does not meet the ideal requirement of animal ethics.
2. Affimer use direct way of production.It is easy to reproduce in e.coli and have no batch to batch variation.
3. Affimer have  higher affinity effect.


Later on, we came up with another application, which was used in HIV test kit. Br. Tiede point out that the antibody in test kit is also used to detect human antibody aginst HIV so it may have some commons in human secondary antibody.


After class, I ask my groupmate to Edward Libary for further discussion. Only four of our gourp number come to our class today. Me, Salma, Xinrui and Zhengjian. I am not happy with the absence of others, they missed important discussion. It is tired to inform them and I am not their parents. But if they are self motivative and ask me, I am happy to explain everything to them and offer help.

We have a long discussion for 2 hours after class and figure our some important things.

First is that we find some of other advantages of affimer compare with antibody.
1. Really short reproduction time. Only about 10-30 days.
2. High production in e.coli.
3. Stablity.

I also think we can produce fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies for immunocytochemistry and in vivo immunostaining. permeabilizing cells using detergent (Triton X-100 or Tween-20) or choosing organic fixatives (acetone, methanol, or ethanol) is necessary in in vivo act. Affimer is small and can be easily to entrance the cell membrane.


My teammate strongly agree with my views. The three of them are amazing. We search a lot of documents, explained to each other, and had a heated discussion until lunch time.
Although none of us have immunological background, we are very serious and learned a lot today.
